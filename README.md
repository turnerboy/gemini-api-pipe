# Gemini API pipe function
---
Here is a python script function for my OpenWebUI container hosted at ai.sriganeshk.com to pipe Google Gemini API so you can send prompts and get a custom AI assistant for free.

### Setup

To wire up the Google Gemini pipe in your OpenWebUI:

1. Log in to your admin panel on your hosted OpenWebUI container  `https://[yourhost]/admin`.  
2. Go to the **Functions** tab and click on the **+** icon you will get a code editor  
3. Name it something like "Google GenAI" on the top and paste in the entire code from `Google GenAI.py`.  
4. Once done click on **Settings icon on Google GenAI function** and enter your Gemini API key under `Google Api Key`  (Toggle `Use Permissive Safety` if you need it).  
6. Save and test—you’ll be able to select a gemini model you need and use prompts to get AI assistant replies straight from OpenWebUI using your API key!

Cheers ^-^
